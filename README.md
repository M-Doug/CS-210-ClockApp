# CS-210-ClockApp
Clock app made for SNHU CS-210

This project was to make a functioning - updateable clock. This demenstrated a basic understanding of the use of functions and normal development cycle. 

This project was my first of C++ and was particually hard because of the difficulty of learning the intial concepts of the language. I feel as if this class did not do a vey good job at establishing the basics of C++, I feel my knowledge from other languages helped me a ton here. Creating Getters and setters, using functions to my advantage, and minimizing the "Main" method was very easy for me. 

While this clock did run and work at a normal pace, I think it could be advanced to include real system time. Unfortunately that was not taught to us by the time this project was made, and the little time I had to attempt just ended in confusion. 

I found the creation of the menu to be the most difficult, as I could not figure out how to pull the function for getting a string length that is inside of a vector. I used examples from stack overflow to help with my learning of this topic. 

All of the basic skills used in this project will be used for future references. The functions will be contained in their own files with header files declaring them. 

This program is maintainable due to the amount of notes that I have left for others to work on in my absence. There is not an unreadable portion of code that is not explained.
